            <li>90g sugar</li>
            <li>15mL water</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Pudding</p>
        <ul>
            <li>500mL milk</li>
            <li>3 eggs</li>
            <li>3 egg yolks</li>
            <li>45g sugar</li>
            <li>250mL heavy cream</li>
            <li>1-1.5tbsp vanilla extract</li>
        </ul>
        <h3<strong>Procedure</strong></h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Pre-heat oven to 130 Celsius</li>
            <li>Add sugar and water into pan, caramelize until dark brown (Refer to an example on Google). Do not let burnt. Pour into 18 cm mold, making sure the spread the caramel evenly. <strong>Be quick! The caramel will cool down quickly and harden.</strong></li>
            <li>Heat 500mL milk, 250mL heavy cream, and 1.5tbsp vanilla extract almost to a boil.</li>
            <li>In a bowl, mix 3 eggs, 3 egg yolks, and 45g sugar. Homogenize but do not over-beat.</li>
            <li>Temper the egg mixture with a ladle-ful of hot milk, slowly add more as you mix vigorously.</li>
            <li>Pour the pudding mixture through a sieve into the mold glazed with caramel.</li>
            <li>Fill a tray up with boiling water, preferably so that the water level is even with the level of the flan mixture.</li>
            <li>Put in oven to bake for 50 minutes. Do not rush the baking process. We want a smooth flan without holes from overcooked eggs.</li>
            <li>Remove flan from the oven. Let it rest until it reaches room temperature then refrigerate for at least 4 hours.</li>
        </ol>
