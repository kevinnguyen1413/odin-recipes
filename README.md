# odin-recipes
Hello! We will be doing our first project in The Odin Project. In this project, we will be writing recipes using utilizing HTML and Git.

We will use elements learned in HTML to setup our webpage, and then we will commit to our GitHub repository using Git commands.

The website will consist of a main index page which will have links to a few recipes. It won't look pretty. The point is to setup a basic webpage first before we move on to CSS for style :D.
